Let's break down the code in detail. This is a simple Pong-like game with a canvas element, where the ball moves, bounces off walls and paddles, and players can control paddles using keyboard input. It also tracks scores and handles game state (such as ending the game and resetting).

Global Variables:
Canvas Setup:

var canvas; — Defines a variable to hold the canvas element.
var canvasContext; — Holds the 2D rendering context for the canvas, used for drawing.
var ballX = 150; — Initial X-coordinate of the ball.
var ballY = 50; — Initial Y-coordinate of the ball.
var ballSpeedX = Math.random() * 5 + 2; — Random horizontal speed for the ball (between 2 and 7 units).
var ballSpeedY = Math.random() * 5 + 2; — Random vertical speed for the ball (between 2 and 7 units).
var framesPerSecond = 30; — The frame rate for the game (30 frames per second).
Paddle Variables:

var leftPaddleY = 150; — Initial Y-coordinate for the left paddle.
var rightPaddleY = 150; — Initial Y-coordinate for the right paddle.
var paddleHeight = 200; — Height of the paddles.
var paddleWidth = 10; — Width of the paddles.
var paddleSpeed = 15; — Speed of the paddle movement.
Score Variables:

var leftScore = 0; — Score for the left player.
var rightScore = 0; — Score for the right player.
var gameOver = false; — Boolean flag to indicate if the game is over.
var resetTimer = 120; — Timer for the reset countdown after a player wins.
Window Onload Function:
The window.onload function initializes the game by:

Logging a message.
Getting the canvas element and context for drawing.
Adding an event listener to listen for keydown events to move paddles.
Using setInterval to update the game every frame (30 times per second).
Main Game Loop:
The game is updated and drawn continuously inside setInterval, calling two functions: moveEverything() and drawEverything(), unless the game is over, in which case it calls displayWinScreen().

Movement and Ball Behavior (moveEverything function):
The ball's position is updated every frame by adding ballSpeedX to ballX and ballSpeedY to ballY.
Ball Wall Collision:

If the ball hits the left or right edges of the canvas, it bounces off by reversing its horizontal direction (ballSpeedX = -ballSpeedX) and slightly altering the speed (ballSpeedX += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2).
Ball Top/Bottom Collision:

If the ball hits the top or bottom walls, it bounces off vertically, reversing ballSpeedY and adding some randomness to the speed.
Paddle Collision:

Left Paddle: If the ball touches the left paddle (X position within range, Y position inside paddle height), it reverses direction and adds randomness to its speed. The left player's score is incremented.
Right Paddle: Similarly, for the right paddle, if the ball touches it, the ball bounces back, the right player's score is incremented.
Winning Condition:

If either player’s score reaches 2, the game ends (gameOver = true), and the reset countdown starts (resetTimer = 30).
Paddle Movement (movePaddles function):
The paddles are moved based on keypresses:

W and S move the left paddle up and down, respectively.
The arrow keys move the right paddle up and down.
The paddles cannot go off-screen, as their positions are restricted to stay within the canvas height.

Drawing the Game (drawEverything function):
The canvas is cleared and filled with a black background.
Both paddles are drawn as white rectangles on their respective sides of the canvas.
The ball is drawn as a white circle at its current position.
A dashed line is drawn vertically in the center of the canvas.
The current scores are displayed in the top-left and top-right corners of the canvas.
Win Screen and Game Reset (displayWinScreen and resetGame functions):
When the game is over, the win screen is displayed with a message saying which player won. A countdown is displayed to show when the game will reset.
Once the countdown reaches 0, the game is reset by calling resetGame(), which resets scores, ball positions, paddle positions, and speed, and sets the game state back to "playing."
Key Points:
The use of setInterval to refresh the game at a fixed frame rate.
Randomized ball movement and bounce mechanics to add unpredictability.
Player input (keyboard) is captured using keydown events to move paddles.
A simple win condition is based on a score of 2 points for either player.
This code creates a functional Pong game where players control paddles to bounce the ball and score points while the game resets after a win.
