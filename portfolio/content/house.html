        <p class="project-description">
            Based on the short fiction by Tina Mahagamage<br><br>
            Logline: “A contemporary photographer struggles to overcome terrifying historical events in order to understand and connect with a mysterious woman who owns a house with a portal through time in Eastern Europe’s secluded Forests.” <br><br>
            The inspiration for “A House in Time” was the desire to write a story for a Virtual Reality Experience. The audience is the protagonist, Caleb, following his mysterious counterpart Sasha as she travels through time using a 1000-year-old house as a portal. The goal is to plunge the viewer in different time periods in order to experience historical events. <br><br> 

For this VR Demo I want the viewer to experience an example of this experience could be if fully realized. It consists of the viewer's first experience of the house in modern times. Inside of the house will be various crucial objects that are embedded within the story that will be used to give the feel of the story. <br><br>

Now Avaliable at the Otis College of Art and Design Library
