          <h3 class="re-title">Abstract</h3>
          <p class="research"><i>The use of virtual technologies is beneficial to the medical field with breakthroughs in surgical sciences and diagnostics.  In the avenue of intervention, this paper explores the potential of creating simulated real-world challenges with communication for patients with Aphasia. Using current models of therapeutic intervention and applying them to an immersive experience.  The scope of the work presented outlines the approach to developing an intervention simulator for patients with Aphasia by using real-world exercises. </i></p>
            
            <!--<h3 class="software-used"></h3>-->
            <p class="research">Recent advancements in virtual reality (VR) technology have opened up new possibilities for its use in medicine, particularly for people with Aphasia. Aphasia limits communication, hindering social interactions and daily activities. VR offers real-time, interactive simulations that engage natural senses, with immersion being key. VR consists of three components: functionality, human interaction, and environment. As T.S. Mujber suggests, the prototype must be clearly defined and realistically simulated, with human functions realistically emulated to create a believable experience. VR is already used in surgical simulations, psychological treatments, pain management, and more, showing its potential to benefit the medical field.</p>

          <h3 class="re-title">Application of VR for Aphasia Intervention</h3>   
          <p class="research">In this scenario, patients will be given the word from a Menu to read.  When the patient says the word correctly, that patient will receive what they asked.  It will be followed up with another question in the same vein.</p>

          <p class="research">The word is Coffee.  "A waiter may ask, would you like Coffee?"  The patient should say Coffee.  If said correctly, Coffee will appear on the table. </p>
          <h3 class="re-title">Creating the Simulation</h3>
          <h4 style="text-align: left;"> <i>Design, Interactivity, Multi-User Functionality and More </i></h4>
          <p class="research">The design process for creating an interactive VR experience begins with understanding the user base and establishing a narrative, in this case, a coffee shop environment with waiter interactions. A mood board is used to guide the environment's design, followed by a 3D sketch. The project is developed in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), chosen for its ability to handle high-quality rendering and real-time visuals. Textures, materials, lighting, and post-processing effects are crucial for realism. <br><Br>

Interactivity is the core of the experience, with UE4's visual scripting system enabling quick development. Virtual Reality (VR) capabilities allow users to interact through a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and touch controllers, with simple triggers and teleportation for movement. Multi-user functionality enables collaboration, with a clinician as the host and the patient as the user.<br><br>      
            
An avatar system helps create realistic immersion, allowing users to visually represent themselves in the VR environment. Audio spatialization enhances immersion by adjusting sound levels based on interaction and movement. Communication is enabled via built-in microphone feedback.<br><br>

Optimization includes beta testing to identify sensory flaws, clinician reviews, and patient testing to assess the experience's effectiveness and gather data on its benefits.<br></p>

<h3 class="re-title">Proof of Concept</h3>   
          <p class="research">Using research and the guidance of a clinician, the recreation of one of the aforementioned exercises will be reimagined in a virtual simulation.  <br><br>

The premise is that the user/patient will appear in a virtual coffee shop in an avatar representation.  The host is there to assist. The user is presented a menu with the word coffee.  When the user says the word coffee correctly the host will then use a trigger method and a coffee will appear on the table.

            <!-- Conclusion Paragraph -->
            <p class="research">Virtual Reality technologies are beneficial medical intervention and rehabilitation.  It is currently being used throughout multiple avenues of the field.  The potential of this technology could lead to medical breakthroughs.  <br><br>
In this experience, VR will be used to create simulated real-world situations for patients reflecting on the current methods of virtual therapies being used today.  The goal is to create a virtual reality simulation for clinicians to improve patients with communication impairments.
