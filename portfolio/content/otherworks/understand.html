            <p class="project-description">In this sketch, I created an audio-reactive kinetic typography piece that explores the complexities of language barriers, cultural identity, and the subtle forms of exclusion experienced by non-English speakers. The text featured in the piece is in Sinhalese, the primary language of Sri Lanka and my father’s native tongue. When I visited Sri Lanka as an adult, I realized I could only say one phrase in Sinhalese: "I don’t understand Sinhalese." That phrase became a symbol of disconnection—an experience of being in a place that is familiar yet linguistically out of reach. <br>

This installation builds on that personal memory and broadens it into a larger commentary on how individuals are often treated differently simply because they don’t speak the dominant language. Many foreigners who don’t speak English, especially in Western contexts, are frequently met with impatience, exclusion, or misunderstanding. This piece is an attempt to bring that reality to light through interactive media.<br>

When the installation space is quiet, the projection remains entirely black—silent and void. But as people begin to speak, their voices are captured by a microphone and translated into movement. At a certain frequency threshold, Sinhalese characters begin to emerge on the screen, slowly forming the phrase "I don’t understand." As the chatter continues, the text distorts and blurs, visually representing the growing confusion, emotional noise, and disorientation often felt by those struggling to communicate in an unfamiliar language.<br></p>

            <p>Built using TouchDesigner, this interactive media piece invites the audience to actively participate in—and reflect on—the dynamics of communication. It not only responds to sound but uses it as a metaphor for presence and exclusion, drawing attention to the often invisible struggles faced by those navigating a world where they don’t understand the words being spoken around them.</p>
