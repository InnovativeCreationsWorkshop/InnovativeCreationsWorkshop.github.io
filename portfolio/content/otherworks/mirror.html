            <h3 class="software-used">Software Used: TouchDesigner</h3>
            <p class="project-description">This body of work explores the intersection of reflection, interactivity, and perception through two distinct yet thematically connected sketches. Drawing inspiration from artist Daniel Rozin’s interactive mirror installations and Marcel Duchamp’s idea that art is only complete when observed, the first piece investigates the concept of the self as both viewer and subject. Using reflections as a medium, the work poses questions about presence, identity, and the role of the observer, all while offering a safe and engaging interactive experience, especially relevant in a post-pandemic world.</p>

            <p class="conclusion">TThis interactive piece draws inspiration from the work of artist Daniel Rozin and builds upon a base project created by Nato the Talking Ball. <br><br>

At its core, this project explores how reflections can be used as a medium for interaction and self-discovery. I'm particularly intrigued by Rozin’s approach to interactive art, especially the way mirrors and reflections become an integral part of the viewer’s experience. As Marcel Duchamp famously suggested, a work of art isn’t truly complete until it’s observed. But what happens when the artwork is a reflection of the observer? How does that change the meaning of the piece—and the experience of the person engaging with it? <br><br>

Through this work, I aim to explore those questions while also addressing the challenges of creating engaging, interactive installations in a post-pandemic world. My goal is to offer a safe, enjoyable, and thought-provoking experience that invites people to see themselves—literally and metaphorically—through art.</p>

            <p class="conclusion">In this sketch, I experiment with ripple and reflection effects inspired by water. Building on the Velikiy Novgorod Water Ripple Effect tutorial, I aimed to understand and expand on the original process. While the foundation of this piece closely follows the tutorial, I introduced an additional layer to enhance the water-like appearance. This was achieved by incorporating noise and a feedback loop, creating a more dynamic and immersive visual experience. Through this work, I'm interested not only in the technical side of the effect but also in how people perceive and respond to these fluid, reflective visuals.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion Paragraph -->
            <p class="conclusion">While both projects are rooted in existing tutorials—one from Nato the Talking Ball and the other from the Velikiy Novgorod Ripple Effect—they each expand on their foundations to explore new creative possibilities. By integrating elements like color cycling, noise, and feedback loops, I aimed to add depth, motion, and emotional resonance to the interactions. These enhancements not only make the works more visually engaging, but also encourage viewers to reflect—both literally and metaphorically—on their relationship to digital environments and their own presence within them. Through this process, I hope to demonstrate how even small modifications to established techniques can open up meaningful new avenues for expression and connection.</p>
