            <h3 class="software-used">Software Used: TouchDesigner</h3>
            <p class="project-description">This body of work explores the intersection of reflection, interactivity, and perception through two distinct yet thematically connected sketches. Drawing inspiration from artist Daniel Rozin’s interactive mirror installations and Marcel Duchamp’s idea that art is only complete when observed, the first piece investigates the concept of the self as both viewer and subject. Using reflections as a medium, the work poses questions about presence, identity, and the role of the observer, all while offering a safe and engaging interactive experience, especially relevant in a post-pandemic world.</p>

            <h3>Rozin's Mirror </h3>
            <p class="conclusion">TThis interactive piece draws inspiration from the work of artist Daniel Rozin and builds upon a base project created by Nato the Talking Ball. <br><br>

At its core, this project explores how reflections can be used as a medium for interaction and self-discovery. I'm particularly intrigued by Rozin’s approach to interactive art, especially the way mirrors and reflections become an integral part of the viewer’s experience. As Marcel Duchamp famously suggested, a work of art isn’t truly complete until it’s observed. But what happens when the artwork is a reflection of the observer? How does that change the meaning of the piece—and the experience of the person engaging with it? <br><br>

Through this work, I aim to explore those questions while also addressing the challenges of creating engaging, interactive installations in a post-pandemic world. My goal is to offer a safe, enjoyable, and thought-provoking experience that invites people to see themselves—literally and metaphorically—through art.</p>
