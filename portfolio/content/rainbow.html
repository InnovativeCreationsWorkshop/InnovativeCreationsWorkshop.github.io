            <h2>A Body in Motion<h2>
            <h3 class="software-used">Technology Used: TouchDesigner, Microsoft Kinect</h3>
            <p class="project-description">This project aimed to create an engaging and interactive experience using the Microsoft Kinect, focusing on hand movement tracking rather than particle-based effects. The goal was to offer users a visually stimulating and fun way to create dynamic art, with color-driven interactions and audio-reactive elements. By leveraging the Kinect's hand tracking capabilities, users could manipulate a virtual canvas, and the visual output would respond to the movement of their hands as well as the audio input.</p>

          
<p class="project-description">To begin, I eliminated the particle effects in favor of hand-tracking data from the Microsoft Kinect. This allowed me to map the user's hand movements to control tracing abilities on the screen. The light-based components were removed, and instead, I provided a color palette designed to be visually enticing and fun to interact with, achieved through the use of a blend mode. The Kinect's player index feature was essential for detecting the user's position and starting the hand-tracking process.<br><br>

The experience was further enhanced by incorporating audio-reactive elements. A generative visualizer was embedded within the user's silhouette, changing shape and morphing in response to the audio input. This feature created a dynamic, responsive interaction between the user's movements and the sound environment.</p>

<p class="project-description">The tracking mechanism itself was similar to the interactive light piece, but instead of following light, it traced the movements of the user's hands. I used a series of mathematical nodes to accurately track the movement of the hands, which in turn generated points to draw lines on the screen.<br><br>

In terms of usability, this experience was designed to be Covid-friendly, limiting interaction to a single user at a time. However, I observed that groups of users were often comfortable participating together, leading me to consider the possibility of expanding the experience to accommodate multiple users simultaneously.<br><br>

  <b>Observations:</b><br><br>

I found the behavior of users to be intriguing. Most individuals instinctively adopted symmetrical movements, with their arms often mirroring each other to create balanced shapes on the screen. Additionally, I observed users using their entire body, not just their hands, to influence the visual output, which added an interesting layer of interaction.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion Paragraph -->
            <p class="conclusion">This project successfully merged technology, art, and audio-reactivity into a single, interactive experience. The use of hand-tracking with the Microsoft Kinect allowed for an intuitive and immersive way for users to create and interact with dynamic visuals. Through further refinement, such as considering a two-user experience, this concept could be expanded to increase interactivity and engagement.</p>
