What if we could walk into a painting and be fully immersed in it?
This is the question posed in this work.  The work consisted of four digital moving paintings that were projected onto a wall in the gallery space.  The works can be viewed by the spectator as a static art objects when projected on the wall, but with Virtual Reality the option of being fully immersed in the paintings is possible.  This work is a combination of augmented reality as well as virtual reality because the digital paintings were in a physical space for viewers to look at, but the full immersive experience was waiting for them in Virtual Reality. 
              
GalleryVR incorporates the concepts of immersion in that is participants walk into a static image and be met with a lively changing environment, complete with audio spatialization and full 360 views giving the participant the perception that they are there.  It also plays with the idea of experiential interactivity because in order to move about these different space in VR the viewer uses a teleportation system that transports them to these spaces.  In order to experience these spaces, the viewer must virtually walk through the paintings to be transported to these worlds.

            <p class="conclusion">For this VR Demo I want the viewer to experience an example of this experience could be if fully realized. It consists of the viewer's first experience of the house in modern times. Inside of the house will be various crucial objects that are embedded within the story that will be used to give the feel of the story.
